# porybox

2 years ago, we heard that pokecheck was getting gen 6 support at the #endofthemonth.
6 months later, it shut down for good.

We are a team of people trying to change this. We are making a replacement.

We are Porygon Co.

Porybox is a platform that allows users to manage their Pok√©mon to easily
display their collections and make more informed trade decisions.
